# Examples

## CLI Usage

Run the marker writer from the command line with any text. Use `$MARKER` to place the cursor where you want the AI to write.

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli --text "<your text with $MARKER>" [--instruction "<optional instruction>"]
```

### Continue at end of text

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli --text "The rise of electric vehicles has changed the automotive industry.$MARKER"
```

### Continue mid-sentence

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli --text "The three most important factors are$MARKER"
```

### Insert between paragraphs

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli \
  --text "## Introduction\n\nAI has transformed how we work.\n\n$MARKER\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe future depends on us." \
  --instruction "write the main body"
```

### Insert mid-paragraph

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli \
  --text "Coffee consumption has risen steadily. $MARKER Today, the average American drinks three cups." \
  --instruction "add a sentence about why"
```

### Inline instruction (paired markers)

Place the instruction between two `$MARKER` tokens:

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli --text "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.$MARKER add a sentence about the cat $MARKER"
```

### Generate from empty document

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli --text "$MARKER" --instruction "write a blog post about sustainable urban farming"
```

### Prepend to existing text

```bash
yarn marker-writer:cli \
  --text "$MARKER The main challenges are communication, timezone coordination, and culture." \
  --instruction "write an engaging introduction"
```

## Running preset examples

```bash
yarn example:list                # list all preset examples
yarn example:all                 # run all 16 examples
yarn example:continue            # run continue examples
yarn example:insert              # run insert examples
yarn example:rewrite             # run rewrite examples
yarn example:expand              # run expand examples
yarn example:delete              # run delete examples
yarn example:generate            # run generate examples
yarn example:inline              # run inline instruction examples
```

## Marker Reference

| Marker        | Code            | Usage                               |

The city had changed in ways no one expected. Buildings that once stood tall now leaned awkwardly against the sky, their facades cracked like ancient pottery. People still walked the streets, but their steps carried a different weight.
